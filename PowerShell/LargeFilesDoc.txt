Project 1: Listing the largest files on the system in GB.

1. Open Powershell

2. Enter the follwing script:

	gci -r| sort -Descending -Property length | select -First 10 name, 
	@{Name ="Gigabytes";Expression={[Math]::Round($_.length / 1GB, 2)}} 

3. Examine the output to see what largest files on the system.

This script uses the gci which is short for "Get-ChildItem" and sorting the files on the system in descending order based on their property length (aka their file size).
Then, its selecting the top 10 results and listing them in GB. The formula used to get Bytes to GB is a simple expression to round their Byte size to the nearest GB to the hundredth place
and naming that column as "Gigabytes".
