### Lab 7 info
	Plugin install and using of the script.
	1. Use cmd to run "python3 -m pip install psutil" or if 'python3' isnt the PATH use the full path to python.exe
	2. run my python script. Its called "computerinfo.py". In this script it will show you the status of your network card(s) on your machine. 
		It will also show you the speed of which they are operating at, and their IP addresses and MAC addresses. 
		
	This Psutil plugin i found is like using powershell to get information from the computer but using python.
