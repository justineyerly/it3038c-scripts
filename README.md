### Lab 7 info
	Plugin install and using of the script.
	1. Use cmd to run "python3 -m pip install psutil" or if 'python3' isnt the PATH use the full path to python.exe
	2. run my python script. Its called "computerinfo.py". In this script it will show you the status of your network card(s) on your machine. 
		It will also show you the speed of which they are operating at, and their IP addresses and MAC addresses. 
		
	This Psutil plugin i found is like using powershell to get information from the computer but using python.
	
#Project 3
	So this was challenging for sure to make, but i made a snakegame. All you have to do is run it and a window for the game should pop up.
	I am not very good at python as it is but i surely did learn a lot through this class so it helped me challenge myself in making it.
	It is not the most fluid game ever but it took me a long time to build on my personal computer first since its much faster to code locally.
	Anyways, i hope you like it and enjoy it!
