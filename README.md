# Project 3
	So this was challenging for sure to make, but i made a snakegame. All you have to do is run it and a window for the game should pop up.
	I am not very good at python as it is but i surely did learn a lot through this class so it helped me challenge myself in making it.
	It is not the most fluid game ever but it took me a long time to build on my personal computer first since its much faster to code locally.
	Anyways, i hope you like it and enjoy it!
